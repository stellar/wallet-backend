## Overview

The wallet-backend service provides several key functionalities:

- **Account Management**: Registration, deregistration, and sponsored account creation
- **Transaction Submission**: Reliable transaction building, submission, and status tracking
- **Payment History**: Tracking and querying of payment records
- **Channel Account Management**: Creation and management of channel accounts for transaction signing
- **Security**: Request authentication and signature verification

## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to start the wallet-backend server for local development and contribution.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23.2 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Running the Server

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stellar/wallet-backend.git
   cd wallet-backend
   ```

2. Copy the example `.env.example` file and fill in the required environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Set environment variables (refer to `.env.example` for details):

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/wallet-backend?sslmode=disable
   NETWORK=testnet
   STELLAR_ENVIRONMENT=development

   # The CHANNEL_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE is used to encrypt/decrypt the channel accounts private keys. A strong passphrase is recommended.
   CHANNEL_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE=<your_passphrase>

   # The DISTRIBUTION_ACCOUNT is used to sponsor fees and reserves for the client transactions. It must be an existing account with XLM balance.
   DISTRIBUTION_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>
   DISTRIBUTION_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY=<your_public_key>

   # CLIENT_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEYS is a comma-separated list of Stellar public keys whose private key(s) are authorized to sign the authentication header. They must be Stellar addresses.
   CLIENT_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEYS=<your_public_keys>
   ```

4. Start the server and its dependencies using one of the following methods:

#### Docker Compose (Quickstart)

This is the simplest way to start the wallet-backend server. All services will run in Docker containers as defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

1. Start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   This will start the `api`, `db`, `ingest`, and `stellar-rpc` services.

#### Local + Docker (Active Development)

This setup is ideal for active development, allowing you to add debug points to the code.

1. Start the `db` and `stellar-rpc` containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d db stellar-rpc
   ```

2. Run `api` and `ingest` locally:

   - **API**
      1. Source the `.env` file:

         ```bash
         source .env
         ```

      2. Run migrations:

         ```bash
         go run main.go migrate up
         ```

      3. Generate channel accounts:

         ```bash
         go run main.go channel-account ensure 5
         ```

      4. Start the API server:

         ```bash
         go run main.go serve
         ```

   - **Ingest**
     1. In a separate terminal, source the `.env` file and run the ingestion service:

        ```bash
        source .env
        go run main.go ingest
        ```

This allows us to establish a dev cycle where you can make changes to the code and restart the `api` and `ingest`
services to test them. Based on the IDE you are using, you can add the build configurations for these services, along
with the environment variables to add breakpoints to your code.

### Testing

The wallet-backend includes both unit and integration tests to ensure comprehensive coverage.

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests can be run using the following command:

```bash
go test ./...
```

**Dependencies:**

- A `db` needs to be available and configured through the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests can be executed with the following command:

```bash
go run main.go integration-tests
```

**Dependencies:**

- Ensure your environment is configured as described in the setup section.
- Both `db` and `stellar-rpc` services should be running, either in Docker containers or locally.

This setup allows you to verify both the isolated functionality of components (unit tests) and their interactions (integration tests) within the wallet-backend.
