# Health Report — 2026-02-25

## Summary

Schema normalization complete. All 117 entries now comply with the required schema fields and valid enum values.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Config enum expansion

**Root cause:** `config.yaml` and `derivation-manifest.md` declared restricted enums that excluded values legitimately used by entries.

**Fix:** Expanded `type` and `status` enums in both files.

| Field | Before | Added |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `type` | `[decision, insight, pattern, gotcha, reference]` | `question`, `fact`, `tension` |
| `status` | `[current, superseded, experimental]` | `active`, `open` |

Files updated:
- `docs/knowledge/ops/config.yaml` (lines 37-43, 106-107)
- `docs/knowledge/ops/derivation-manifest.md` (lines 41-42)

### 2. Batch 2 entries missing required fields

**Root cause:** 47 entries created in "Batch 2" (2026-02-24) had minimal frontmatter — only `context`, `type`, and `created`. They were missing `status`, `subsystem`, and `areas`.

**Fix:** Inferred and populated all three missing fields for all 47 entries.

| Subsystem | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| data-layer | 24 |
| graphql | 14 |
| ingestion | 5 |
| signing | 3 |
| services | 2 |

Status distribution across the 47 entries:
- `status: current` — 44 entries
- `status: open` — 3 entries (question-type entries: `opaque base64 cursors`, `whether synchronous_commit=off`, `whether the 5ms dataloader`)

## Verification Results

Post-fix grep counts across `docs/knowledge/entries/*.md`:

| Field | Files with match | Expected |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| `^subsystem:` | 117 entries | 117 ✓ |
| `^status:` | 117 entries | 117 ✓ |
| `^areas:` | 117 entries | 117 ✓ |

Enum validation:
- Type violations: 0
- Status violations: 0
- Subsystem violations: 0

## Current Vault State

- Total entries: 117
- Schema-compliant: 117 (100%)
- Knowledge maps: 7 (`index.md`, `ingestion.md`, `graphql-api.md`, `data-layer.md`, `signing.md`, `services.md`, `authentication.md`)
