# /next Log

## 2026-02-23 22:30

**State:** Captures: 0 | Entries: 7 (all knowledge-map shells, 0 substantive entries) | Orphans: 7 | Sessions (unmined): 5 | Queue: 0 pending | Obs: 0 | Tensions: 0
**Recommended:** Complete `references/signing-and-channels.md` — read `internal/signing/` and fill all TODO sections
**Rationale:** Task stack has 10 open items; reference docs are all partial stubs. Signing-and-channels covers the most complex subsystem and is the highest-impact incomplete reference.
**Priority:** task-stack
