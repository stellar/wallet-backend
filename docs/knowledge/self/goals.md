# Active Goals

## Immediate

- [ ] Document core architectural decisions (TimescaleDB choice, channel account design, schema-first GraphQL)
- [ ] Complete TODO sections in reference docs (signing-and-channels.md, services.md, authentication.md, overview.md)
- [ ] Establish baseline entries for each subsystem

## Medium-term

- [ ] Document common debugging patterns for ingestion failures
- [ ] Capture Stellar RPC quirks and gotchas
- [ ] Document hypertable tuning decisions

## Long-term

- [ ] Expand to cover additional Stellar ecosystem repos
- [ ] Automate stale-entry detection via periodic health checks

## Getting Started

New to this knowledge system? Start at `[[entries/index]]` — the hub knowledge map links to all subsystem maps and from there to individual entries and reference docs.
