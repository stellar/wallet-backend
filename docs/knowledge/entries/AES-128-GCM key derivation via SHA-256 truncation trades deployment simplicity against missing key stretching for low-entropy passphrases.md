context: SHA-256 is a fast hash — it does not defend against brute-force attacks on weak passphrases the way PBKDF2/argon2 would; a high-entropy passphrase from a secret manager is the expected deployment

AES-128-GCM key derivation via SHA-256 truncation trades deployment simplicity against missing key stretching for low-entropy passphrases. The scheme works correctly for high-entropy passphrases (generated by a secret manager or KMS): SHA-256 is a deterministic transformation of the passphrase, and 16 bytes of it are sufficient for AES-128. The problem arises with low-entropy human-chosen passphrases: SHA-256 is designed to be fast (billions of evaluations per second on GPU), making brute-force practical. A proper password-based KDF like PBKDF2 or argon2 would add deliberate computational cost to slow attackers. The current design accepts this risk on the assumption that production deployments use high-entropy passphrases injected from a secrets manager rather than human-chosen strings. See also [[AES-128-GCM key derivation uses SHA-256(passphrase) truncated to 16 bytes rather than a password-based KDF]].
